## Build Info
Windows 10 Home, Version 10.0.19045 Build 19045. Will most likely only properly run on windows, \ is used in file paths instead of /

## Application Details

Followed application specifications, a few minor additions are:  
1. Options menu item has an about item, with some info about the application
2. Empty directories show text in the center pane that says the directory is empty
3. Directories show a folder icon on the center pane
4. Unsupported files show an image that says unsupported file type
5. Deleting a directory shows some metadata about the file when the confirmation windows pops up, differentiates between files and directories in the confirmation window
6. The Home, Next, and Previous buttons also show under the file menu bar, as they are related to what files you see. The Previous hotkey is the space bar
7. Menu items and Toolbar buttons for Home, Next, Prev are disabled/Enabled depending on which directory and file the explorer is in
8. Custom App Icon, I assume this isn't a major thing so I made it fun :)
